# Cantilever Snap Fit System

This repository contains the design files and visual documentation for a basic cantilever snap fit system intended for 3D printing and iterative prototyping.

## Overview

Cantilever snap fits are commonly used in plastic part design to enable reversible assembly without fasteners. This system demonstrates a simple male-female locking interface, designed with additive manufacturing tolerances in mind.

The current version is `v3`.

## üí° Design Considerations

- Material: PLA for FDM 3D printing
- Clearance: Designed with a 0.15 mm press-fit offset for standard printer tolerances
- Snap fit type: **Cantilever beam** with a locking ledge
- Modeled for iterative design: geometry can be adjusted for stiffness or fit
